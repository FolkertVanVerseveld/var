Various programming snippets or projects that I've been using when I want to
start a new project quickly or I need a simple hack because the language I'm
using sucks or doesn't provide support for certain features.

Most files include a reference to the license that applies, but if no reference
is provided, it defaults to public domain.

Whatever the license, if you intend to use any code from this repo, I would
really appreciate if you mention my name in the credits.

Let me know if you have made something really cool that I need to see!  If it is
a commercial product, I would like to receive a free licensed copy (not
required, but that would be awesome).

I don't intend to accept pull requests, as this is code written only by me and
this gives me a lot of freedom. If I change the license of a particular file you
can always choose to keep using the old version that uses the old license.
