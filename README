Yeah, I know this does not say much.

Most files include a reference to the license that applies,
If no reference is provided, it defaults to public domain.

Whatever the license, if you intend to use any code from this repo,
I would really appreciate if you mention my name in the credits.

Let me know if you have made something really cool that I need to see!
If it is a commercial product, I would like to receive a free licensed
copy (not required, but that would be awesome).

I don't intend to accept pull requests, as this is code written only by
me and this gives me a lot of freedom. If I change the license of a
particular file you can always choose to keep using the old version that
uses the old license.
