Programs for argument parsing during startup.

Arguments can be provided in multiple ways: starting with a single or double
dash, key-value arguments like key=value, key value or keyvalue.

Not all mentioned formattings are supported. The programs are self-contained and
small enough to just look up the source code to see if it is supported.
